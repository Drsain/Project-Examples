# Coding Examples
A collection of intriguing programs that I have completed both during school and outside the classroom.

## [Kriging Final Project (2022)](/Stat2_Final_Project/Stat2_Report.pdf)
The final project of my Applied Statistics II class. For this project I decided to research Kriging, an advanced statistical technique that we did not learn about in class. I investigated and created a model to investigate some weather station data from the GHCN. The report is included. 

## [Natural Language Processing (2021)](/Natural_Language_Processing_Project/NLP_Report.pdf)
The final project for my natural language processing class. Another student and myself decided to tackle the second SemEval task which was trying to figure out how to translate a given definition to a single word. The report of the project is included. 

## [Machine Learning (2021)](/Machine_Learning_Project/ML_Report.pdf)
Working with a small team of three during my machine learning class, we aspired to create a machine learning algorithm that would make our lives as students easier. Thus we created a 'test taking' algorithm. We used a hugging face neural network to read in various pages from a textbook and then answer questions based on those pages. The report of the project is included.

## [HackCU (2020)](https://github.com/jacobfelknor/PostGold---HackCU2020)
The team buit a Markov chain based text generator based on input data from different sources, including twitter, reddit, and famous speeches. 

## [Heroku Deployed APP (2019)](/Heroku_Deployed_App.zip)
I worked with a team of five during my software development class to create a 'Net Worth Calculator'. We used mySQL for the back end, HTML and CSS for the front end and javascript for the connection. I worked on the front end, the HTML and CSS used to create the visual aspects of the website, as well as most of the javascript at the end of the project.
