# Coding Examples
A collection of intriguing programs that I have completed both during school and outside the classroom.

## Kriging Final Project (2022)
The final project of my applied statistics 2 class. For this final I decided to research into an advanced statistical technique that we were not taught in class, Kriging. I investigated, and created a model to investigate the data that I had collected. The report is included. 

## Natural Language Processing (2021)
The final project for my natural language processing class. Here another student and myself decided to tackle the second SemEval task that year, trying to figure out how to translate a given definition to a single word. The report of the project is included. 

## Machine Learning (2021)
Working with a small team of three during my machine learning class, we aspired to create a machine learning algorithm that would make our lives as students easier. Thus we created a 'test taking' algorithm. We used a hugging face neural network to read in various texts from a textbook then answer questions based on those texts. The report of the project is included.

## Heroku Deployed APP (2019)
I worked with a team of 5 during my software development class to create a piece of software. We decided to do a 'Net Worth Calculator'. We used mySQL for the back end, HTML and CSS for the front end and javascript for the connection. I started to work on the front end. Me and another student worked on the HTML and CSS used to create the visual aspects of the website. I ended up working on most of the javascript at the end of the project. I was involved in all of the javascript except for two of the javascript functions included in the final patch.

## Hack CU (2018)
I worked in a team of three to use the Twitter API to create a project. I mostly did HTML with the flask implementation to connect the HTML to the python. My other two partners did the base HTML code and the python algorithms. Unfortunately to protect the Twitter account that we linked the project to, we cannot provide the access keys and consumer keys. In order for the program to work one must get these themselves.

## Chalk Cliffs Pictures (2018)
Working as a research assistant with William Kleiber in CU's Applied Math Department, we were investigating a geologically active region called the Chalk Cliffs. Using a software called CloudCompare I was able to investigate fitting two large sets of cloud data(60+ million points) in the same x-y coordinate using different processes. I also cut out smaller samples for fitting, and I examined other tools that CloudCompare offered.

## Cars (2018)
Using R-Studio I read in a database of cars from a car search website. Based on certain characteristics of the cars I would plot various graphs, including a regression line. I would then find the car farthest below that line in order to find the best deal for the two variables being listed.

## FBLA-library (2018)
I was charged with creating a computer system that could track instances of books and students in a school library. I would need to have ways to track specific books, track the students and teachers that have checked out the books, and also have a report on overdue books. I did this in Python, utilizing Python's dictionary data type and the class system. I also include the library "time" to track how long a book has been checked out. This was for the Future Business Leaders of America, Coding and Programming, competition. I won first in district, third in state and attended nationals.

## War-Games (2018)
For my final in CSCI 1300 class, I was charged with using everything that we learned to create a project. I decided to create a video game with the classic board game Risk in mind. I used a multidimensional array and various classes to control a ‘board’ of sorts. I also included a simple AI that controls the computer players in the game. The ‘battles’ between armies were probability-based simulations. Finally I had a save game and load game function.
