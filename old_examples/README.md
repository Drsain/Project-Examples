# Old Examples
This is a collection of older examples from the beginning of my career and no longer represent my ability to work. 

## [Hack CU (2019)](/old_examples/HackCU52019_master/)
I worked in a team of three to use the Twitter API to create a project. I mostly did HTML with the flask implementation to connect the HTML to the python. My other two partners did the base HTML code and the python algorithms. Unfortunately to protect the Twitter account that we linked the project to, we cannot provide the access keys and consumer keys. In order for the program to work one must get these themselves.

## [Chalk Cliffs Pictures (2018)](/old_examples/Pictures/)
Working as a research assistant with William Kleiber in CU's Applied Math Department, we were investigating a geologically active region called the Chalk Cliffs. Using a software called CloudCompare I was able to investigate fitting two large sets of cloud data(60+ million points) in the same x-y coordinate using different processes. I also cut out smaller samples for fitting, and I examined other tools that CloudCompare offered.

## [Cars (2018)](/old_examples/Cars/)
Using R-Studio I read in a database of cars from a car search website. Based on certain characteristics of the cars I would plot various graphs, including a regression line. I would then find the car farthest below that line in order to find the best deal for the two variables being listed.

## [War-Games (2018)](/old_examples/War_Games/)
For my final in CSCI 1300 class, I was charged with using everything that we learned to create a project. I decided to create a video game with the classic board game Risk in mind. I used a multidimensional array and various classes to control a ‘board’ of sorts. I also included a simple AI that controls the computer players in the game. The ‘battles’ between armies were probability-based simulations. Finally I had a save game and load game function.

## [FBLA-library (2018)](/old_examples/FBLA/)
I was charged with creating a computer system that could track instances of books and students in a school library. I would need to have ways to track specific books, track the students and teachers that have checked out the books, and also have a report on overdue books. I did this in Python, utilizing Python's dictionary data type and the class system. I also include the library "time" to track how long a book has been checked out. This was for the Future Business Leaders of America, Coding and Programming, competition. I won first in district, third in state and attended nationals.
