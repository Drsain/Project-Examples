# Coding Examples
A collection of intriguing programs that I have completed both during school and outside the classroom.


## FBLA-library
I was charged with creating a computer system that could track instances of books and students in a school library. I would need to have ways to track specific books, track the students and teachers that have checked out the books, and also have a report on overdue books. I did this in Python, utilizing Python's dictionary data type and the class system. I also include the library "time" to track how long a book has been checked out. This was for the Future Business Leaders of America, Coding and Programming, competition. I won first in district, third in state and attended nationals.

## War-Games
For my final in CSCI 1300 class, I was charged with using everything that we learned to create a project. I decided to create a video game with the classic board game Risk in mind. I used a multidimensional array and various classes to control a ‘board’ of sorts. I also included a simple AI that controls the computer players in the game. The ‘battles’ between armies were probability-based simulations. Finally I had a save game and load game function.

## Cars
Using R-Studio I read in a database of cars from a car search website. Based on certain characteristics of the cars I would plot various graphs, including a regression line. I would then find the car farthest below that line in order to find the best deal for the two variables being listed.

## Chalk Cliffs Pictures
Working as a research assistant with William Kleiber in CU's Applied Math Department, we were investigating a geologically active region called the Chalk Cliffs. Using a software called CloudCompare I was able to investigate fitting two large sets of cloud data(60+ million points) in the same x-y coordinate using different processes. I also cut out smaller samples for fitting, and I examined other tools that CloudCompare offered.
